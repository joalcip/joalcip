# A Roadmap to Democratic AI

<b> When it comes to AI, we can still take the democratic pathâ€”but it is not the default one.</b> Our social institutionsâ€”corporations, government, bureaucracyâ€”are not currently equipped to take on this task. Democratic innovation is a public good: it is systematically under-provided without intervention. This is especially true for democratic innovation in governing AI. Practically, itâ€™s hard to develop better decision-making and distribution mechanisms that match the speed, focus, and concentration of resources driving the worldâ€™s shiniest technology. Itâ€™s hard to improve collective intelligence at the rate weâ€™re improving artificial intelligence. But thatâ€™s what we need to do.

<b> We founded the Collective Intelligence Project to find a new default path, and to build a better future.</b> This work requires experimentation, commitment, resources, partnership, and coalition-building. Weâ€™re grateful for the opportunity to work alongside, and learn from, inspiring colleagues who share our goal: to ensure that progress, participation, and safety donâ€™t have to trade off. Why democratic AI? We think of democracy as more than deliberation, public input, or elections. At its core, democracy is a set of adaptive, accountable institutions that process and act on decentralized information, provide public goods, and safeguard peopleâ€™s freedom, wellbeing, and autonomy. When we say democratic AI, we mean an AI ecosystem that does the same, by default. <b>This document is our attempt to concretely describe what can be immediately done, built, researched, advocated for, and funded in 2024 in the AI ecosystem to achieve that goal.</b>

Itâ€™s worth saying up front: <b> We do not think this document is exhaustive.</b> We donâ€™t discuss AIâ€™s impact on the nuts and bolts of existing, nation-state democracy. We donâ€™t cover the necessary role of stronger labor movements or a robust and expanded social safety net, nor do we discuss many ways we think AI could be used for direct public benefit, from healthcare to public services to education. We are an R&D lab at heart; our focus here reflects this. Finally, this is a living document. We believe in collective intelligence; naturally, we also believe weâ€™re probably missing something that you know. <b> If you have an idea or a good example that we missed, if you vigorously disagree and are willing to walk us through your reasoning, or if you want to collaborate on the next steps below, please feel free to work with us on this document, or reach out to us at hi@cip.org.</b>

Weâ€™re still early, but that doesnâ€™t mean we have much time. If you share this vision, we want to work with you, build with you, and support you. 

Letâ€™s do this.

## The Destination: What would democratic AI look like in 2030?

We expect the world will look quite different in 2030. But here are three pillars
we think are necessary for democratic AI, and provide especially fertile
opportunities for experimentation, advocacy, and research.

This list is by no means exhaustive. Instead, in the spirit of democratic
collaboration, we thought it was important to have a point of view and stake
out a perspective where others may disagree.

1. Our capacity for collective intelligence begins to keep pace with
progress in artificial intelligence. We use AI to improve our systems
for deliberation, translation, facilitation, and preference elicitation; We
expand this to improve interactions within and between institutions, as
well as between institutions and individuals.
Impact: Weâ€™ll be much better at understanding and actualizing
collective preferences.

3. Important AI systems are governed by feedback loops of collective
input. We have built the infrastructure to inclusively gather, parse, and
incorporate public input on complex questions surrounding AI. This
includes responsively building AI systems to target real community
needs, and enabling responsive opt-out of AI systems.
Impact: Collective preferences directly inform any high-impact
systems.

5. High-impact sites of AI development are (re)structured to optimize
for the collective interest. The core material inputs to AI (data and
compute) are governed non-monopolistically. Sites of development
and deployment, whether open source movements, corporations,
startups, or government agencies, are subject to checks and balances
to mitigate against power centralization.
Impact: Weâ€™re not just gathering collective input, weâ€™ve shifted
incentives and built institutional capacity to actually compel
action based on the public interest.

We also want there to be a variety of models that all sorts of people can use
safely, opt-out guarantees for users, and strong data protection rules â€” not to
mention many positive use-cases for AI. But these three achievements would
massively change the political economy of AI, and they form a foundation for
our vision.
